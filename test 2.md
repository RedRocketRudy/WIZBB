I would like you to help me create a spell system like this (Preparation Stage: Create a list of base spells, each with a description. The description should be detailed enough to facilitate the visualization concept. It should contain information about the spell's effect, area of effect, and perhaps some lore or flavor text. For instance, a base spell could be "Flames of Ardentia: The caster's hands emit a burst of searing flames, scorching everything in a 10-foot radius. The ancient wizards of Ardentia were known to use this spell to forge magical artifacts."

Casting Stage: Each time a spell is cast, add it to a 'recently cast spells' list. This list will be used to generate the wild magic evolutions.

Wild Magic Evolution Stage: After a certain number of spells have been cast in quick succession (you can define this number based on your game mechanics), trigger a wild magic evolution. To generate the wild magic spell:

a. Select a subset of recently cast spells. These will form the basis for the wild magic spell.

b. From each selected spell, extract a certain percentage of the words (between 65% and 92% as per your description). These words should be randomly selected, ensuring that the combination is unique.

c. Recombine the words into a new spell description. The combination process could include a rule to ensure that the new spell is grammatically correct and makes sense in the context of the game.

d. Assign a power level to the wild magic spell. This could be based on the number of spells that contributed to it, the power level of those spells, or a random factor.

e. Add the new wild magic spell to the 'recently cast spells' list, so it can contribute to future wild magic evolutions.

Evaluation Stage: Whenever a wild magic spell is cast, evaluate its effect. Depending on the game mechanics, this could cause damage, create an area of effect, apply a status effect, or trigger some other game event.
1. **SparkGust**: With a sweeping gesture, the caster conjures a gust of wind that carries a swarm of tiny sparks. The sparks dance on the breeze, seeking out flammable objects and igniting them upon contact. This spell is a favorite among those who wish to create distractions or ignite distant targets.

2. **StoneMeld**: The caster's body takes on the texture and color of stone, allowing them to blend seamlessly into rocky surroundings. This spell is perfect for those seeking to hide in plain sight or evade physical harm, their bodies temporarily adopting the hardiness of stone itself.

3. **WaterWhisper**: The caster extends their consciousness into nearby bodies of water, enabling a two-way communication. The water reveals its secrets, whispering tales of hidden paths and hidden treasures. This spell is a boon for explorers and seekers of lost lore.

4. **FlameFlicker**: With a snap of their fingers, the caster creates a small, bright flame at their fingertips. This flame burns without consuming, providing a source of light that does not wane. It's an essential spell for those who venture into the dark.

5. **AirLift**: By manipulating the air currents, the caster can lift and move light objects. The objects float on the wind as if caught in an invisible stream. This spell is handy for those who need to retrieve or manipulate items from a distance.

6. **EarthArmour**: Calling upon the strength of the earth, the caster forms a protective layer of compacted soil and rock around their body. This earthen armor offers robust physical protection against attacks. 

7. **FireDance**: Flames nearby begin to sway and twist, mirroring the movements of the caster. This spell lends a dramatic flair to the caster's actions and can serve as a mesmerizing distraction or a means of controlling fire.

8. **WaterBalm**: By harnessing the soothing properties of water, the caster can alleviate minor injuries and refresh the weary. The spell causes water to glow with a soft, healing light and apply its balm-like effect.

9. **AirEcho**: This spell allows the caster to send their voice riding on the wind, delivering messages to a specific recipient. The message echoes through the air currents, reaching its intended recipient no matter the distance.

10. **StoneSight**: The caster's eyes become one with the stone, allowing them to see through stone structures as if they were transparent. This spell reveals hidden rooms, traps, or persons on the other side of stone barriers.

11. **FlameFriend**: The caster forms a mystical bond with small, non-magical flames, making them friendly and harmless. These flames refuse to burn the caster, their warmth felt without the sting of burns.

12. **WaterWalk**: The caster's steps become light, enabling them to walk on water as if it were solid ground. This spell allows traversing lakes and rivers with ease, stepping on the surface as if on a cobblestone path.

13. **AirBubble**: The caster creates a bubble of breathable air that surrounds their head, providing oxygen in environments where it is scarce. This spell is invaluable for underwater exploration or in areas filled with poisonous gases.

14. **SparkWrite**: Calling upon tiny sparks, the caster can etch messages or designs onto wooden or paper surfaces. The sparks trace the desired symbols, their heat leaving permanent marks without causing unwanted fires.)
