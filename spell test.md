**Tag Word Library & Spell Dictionary**

1. **Tag Word Library**: This will be a collection of all the possible words that can be used to construct a spell. These words will be categorized into different types based on their function, such as "Element" (Fire, Water, Air, Earth), "Shape" (Spark, Bubble, Wave, Dome), "Movement" (Dash, Burst, Slash, Line), "Effect" (Burn, Freeze, Shock, Push), and so on.

2. **Spell Dictionary**: This will be a repository of all the spells that the player has learned or cast. Each spell will have a description that includes a specific combination of tag words. For example, the spell "FireSpark" will have a description like "a Small Spark of Fire that Bursts Forward."

**Spell Casting System**

1. **Spell Creation**: When the player casts a spell, the tag words from the spell's description are stored in a temporary "Spell Memory." For example, casting "FireSpark" will store the tags "Fire," "Spark," and "Burst" in the Spell Memory.

2. **Memory Limit**: The Spell Memory will have a limit to prevent the system from being overwhelmed and to maintain balance. This limit could be a specific number of spells or a specific number of tag words.

3. **Spell Evolution**: If the player casts spells in rapid succession, the Spell Memory will be filled with the tag words from those spells. When the Memory Limit is reached, a "Wild Magic Evolution" is triggered. The system will randomly select 65%-92% of the words in the Spell Memory and combine them to create a new, higher-level spell. This new spell is then added to the Spell Dictionary, and its tag words are removed from the Spell Memory.

4. **Advanced Spells**: Some tag words can combine to form "Advanced Tag Words" that have more potent effects. For example, if the words "Fire" and "Burst" are both in the Spell Memory, they could combine to form the Advanced Tag Word "Explosion."

5. **Spell Memory Management**: The player can manage their Spell Memory by casting a variety of spells to control which tag words are stored. This adds a strategic element to the game, as the player must plan their spell casting to achieve specific combinations of tag words.

**Implementation Example**

Here's a simplified example of this system in action:

1. The player casts "FireSpark," storing "Fire," "Spark," and "Burst" in the Spell Memory.

2. The player then casts "WaterBubble," storing "Water," "Bubble," and "Burst" in the Spell Memory. Now the Spell Memory contains "Fire," "Spark," "Burst," "Water," "Bubble," and "Burst."

3. The player casts "AirDash," storing "Air," "Dash," and "Burst" in the Spell Memory. Now the Spell Memory contains "Fire," "Spark," "Burst," "Water," "Bubble," "Burst," "Air," "Dash," and "Burst."

4. With the Spell Memory now full (assuming a limit of 9 tag words), a Wild Magic Evolution is triggered. The system randomly selects 65%-92% of the words and combines them to create a new spell.

5. The system selects "Fire," "Water," "Bubble," "Dash," and "Burst" and combines them to form the new spell "SteamBubbleDash," a dash move that leaves a trail of scalding steam bubbles. This new spell is added to the Spell Dictionary, and its tag words are removed from the Spell Memory.

This streamlined spell system should keep gameplayexciting and dynamic, as players experiment with different spell combinations and work towards triggering Wild Magic Evolutions. The management of the Spell Memory adds a layer of strategic planning, encouraging players to consider their spell casting sequences carefully. The introduction of Advanced Tag Words also provides additional depth, rewarding players for clever usage and combination of spells. 

**Refining the Spell System**

1. **Spell Casting Interface**: A clean, intuitive interface is critical for the spell casting system. Players should be able to easily see their current Spell Memory and understand the potential outcomes of their spell casting sequences. Tooltips or a help guide could be included to assist players in understanding the function of different tag words and how they can be combined.

2. **Spell Casting Feedback**: To make the spell casting experience more engaging, provide clear visual and audio feedback when spells are cast, especially during Wild Magic Evolutions. This could include animations, particle effects, sound effects, and changes to the game environment.

3. **Spell Learning and Progression**: As the player progresses through the game, they should unlock more tag words and spell combinations. This could be tied to character progression, completion of quests, discovery of artifacts, or exploration of the game world. 

4. **Balancing and Difficulty Curve**: The spell system will need to be carefully balanced to ensure a smooth difficulty curve. Early game spells should be simple and straightforward, allowing players to learn the basic mechanics. As the player progresses, the spells can become more complex and powerful, requiring more strategic planning and management of the Spell Memory.


Here is a breif description of the games so far could you create a plan to make that game along with finding unity packages that would help with the process "In this magic system, spells are cast by visualizing their effects in one's imagination. However, casting too many spells in rapid succession can cause residual descriptions from previous spells to linger in the caster's mind. This lingering effect triggers a "wild magic evolution," resulting in the spontaneous creation of a random, higher-level spell. The new spell will contain 65%-92% of the words in the description of the previous spells, recombined in a unique manner. For example, if a caster rapidly casts the following spells: FireSpark: A small spark of fire that bursts forward. WaterBubble: A small bubble of water that bursts. AirDash: Dash forward in a cloak of air. PebbleBlast: A small ball of earth that bursts on impact. The wild magic evolution might generate a new, higher-level spell such as: FireWake: Dash forward in a cloak of fire, releasing small waves of fire. EarthBubble: A dome of earth cubes that can burst forward. LightningWave: A wave of lightning sparks released in a line. BubbleWhip: Slash a line of water bubbles forward. These higher-level spells are unpredictable and can have powerful, unintended effects. This magic system adds an element of risk and excitement, as casters must be cautious when casting multiple spells quickly. The potential for unexpected spell combinations keeps users on their toes and adds an extra layer of strategy and creativity to their magical abilities."
