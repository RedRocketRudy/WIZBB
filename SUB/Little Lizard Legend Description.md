You play as a mythical wizard trapped inside the "Cradle of Elementals," a raging storm of elemental magic triggered by the elemental planes' attempt to sever their connection with a wizard who turned themselves into an elemental font, spreading magic throughout the world. The game features a stylized cartoon shader art style, combining a visually appealing and unique aesthetic with an immersive, magical world.

Magic in this world is cast by visualizing its effects in one's imagination. However, casting too many spells in rapid succession can lead to wild magic evolutions, creating random, higher-level spells with unpredictable and powerful effects. These spells contain parts of the description of the previous spells, recombined uniquely.

The Cradle of Elementals is filled with elemental soldiers, elite elementals, higher-grade beings, and portals to the elemental planes. Elemental shards, released when elementals are destroyed, are a highly sought-after resource that can be used as magical fuel, tools, or foci.

The game's goal is to navigate this storm, learn to control wild magic evolutions, and manage resources while understanding the complex dynamics of the elemental planes and their factions.

The world outside the Cradle largely ignores it, focusing instead on utilizing elemental shards for various purposes. The trading and distribution of elemental shards have significant impacts on the world's economy and social structures, creating a rich background for exploration and player interaction.

Groups or factions within the world that study the Cradle of Elementals, despite the inherent risks, add another layer of intrigue to the game. Understanding their goals and motivations may reveal new insights or opportunities for the player.

The conflict between the elemental planes and the wizard-elemental font has repercussions on the world and its inhabitants, presenting an ever-changing environment for the player to navigate.

The game is planned to be sold directly, with an initial donation-based model on itch.io before releasing on Steam and possibly consoles. This indie game promises a unique blend of immersive storytelling, strategic resource management, and creative magic system, providing a fresh and engaging experience for players.
