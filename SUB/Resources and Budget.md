Given the complexity of the game's magic system, a significant risk is that it could become too complicated or unbalanced. To mitigate this, regular playtesting and adjustments will be carried out throughout development. Feedback from these playtests will be essential for refining the system and making it enjoyable and intuitive for players.

Another risk is development delays due to unforeseen challenges or scope creep. To manage this, a detailed development plan will be adhered to, with clear milestones and deadlines. If certain features or content prove too time-consuming, they may be scaled back or saved for post-launch updates.

In case of financial difficulties, the game could be released in an early access state to generate revenue and gather player feedback for further development. Crowdfunding or seeking additional investment are other potential options.
