### Game Mechanics

1.  [[Spell Casting]]: This is the primary method of interaction in the game. Players combine words from the descriptions of previously cast spells, with the power of each word charge determining the power of the resulting spell. Spells can be combined in a multitude of ways, with each unique combination resulting in different effects. Rapid casting can trigger wild magic evolutions, creating powerful and unpredictable spells.
    
2.  [[Resource Management]]: Elemental shards are the primary resources in the game, obtained by defeating elementals. These shards can be used to upgrade player stats, enhance artifacts, or manage the phylactery. Players must carefully manage their resources to progress, choosing when to spend shards and when to save them.
    
3.  [[Platform Creation]]: Players can use the last element from a spell to create platforms in the air, allowing for double jumps. This mechanic adds a level of verticality to the game, opening up new possibilities for exploration and combat.
    
4.  [[Phylactery Management]]: The phylactery is both a boon and a burden to players. It reduces movement speed and jump height, adding an extra level of difficulty to navigation and combat. However, it also allows players to respawn close to their death location, reducing the penalty for failure.
1.  [[Spell Casting]]: The player casts spells by combining words obtained from the descriptions of previously cast spells. The more powerful the word charge, the more advanced the spell. Spells can have a variety of effects, from offensive attacks to defensive barriers, transportation methods, and more.
    
2.  [[Wild Magic Evolution]]: If the player casts spells too rapidly, they may trigger a wild magic evolution, resulting in the creation of a random, high-level spell. These evolved spells are unpredictable and can turn the tide of battle.
    
3.  [[Elemental Shards]]: The player collects elemental shards from defeated elementals. These shards can be used to enhance the player's abilities, upgrade artifacts, and manage their phylactery.
    
4.  [[Phylactery Management]]: The player's phylactery acts as a checkpoint system and also as a handicap, reducing their speed and jump height. The player must strategically manage their phylactery to balance its benefits and drawbacks.
    
5.  [[Faction Interactions]]: The player can interact with the various elemental factions within the Cradle, forming alliances, making enemies, and potentially shifting the balance of power within the Cradle.
### Game Features

1.  **Torn Tomes:** The first artifacts the player will find are torn tomes, each containing six spells: four basic spells of the lowest level and two unique movement spells. These tomes serve as the player's initial spellbook, providing a foundation for their magical abilities.
    
2.  **Spell Slots and Spell Dictionary:** The player has four spell slots in which they can equip known spells from their spell dictionary. The spell dictionary evolves and expands as the player casts spells, completes puzzles, and helps animals or NPCs in the Cradle of Elementals. This mechanic encourages exploration and interaction with the game world.
    
3.  **Thematic Artifacts:** Hidden throughout the game are thematic artifacts that teach the player new spell casting styles. Each artifact is associated with a unique puzzle that the player must solve in order to obtain it. These artifacts add depth to the spell casting system and provide varied gameplay experiences.
    
    a. **Drum of the Rhythm Adept:** This artifact adds a beat counter UI that follows the game's music. Casting spells on the beat grants bonuses, adding a rhythm game element to the spell casting mechanic.
    
    b. **Dagger of the Arcane Duelist:** This artifact causes spells to take a more compact form, increasing their damage at the cost of reducing their range. This artifact is ideal for players who prefer close-quarters combat.
    
    c. **Shield and Hammer of the Elemental Artificer:** This artifact increases the effectiveness of defensive and construction/trap/totem spells or spells that resemble manufactured items. It encourages a more defensive and strategic playstyle.
    
4.  **Elemental Shards and Energy Mist:** Elemental Shards and Energy Mist are collectible resources that players can use to upgrade their stats, improve their artifacts, or manage their phylactery. They are released upon defeating elementals and can also be found scattered throughout the game world.
    
5.  **Dynamic Environment and NPCs:** The game features a dynamic environment with various animals and NPCs that the player can interact with. Helping these creatures can yield rewards and new spells, encouraging the player to engage with the game world and its inhabitants.

### Levels
The game is set in the Cradle of Elementals, a raging storm of elemental magic that serves as the game world. The Cradle is divided into various biomes, each representing a different elemental plane.

1.  **Fire Plane:** A scorched wasteland with rivers of lava and burning skies, this biome is home to fire elementals and presents a harsh, unforgiving environment. The unique mechanic of this level could involve heat management and fire-based puzzles.
    
2.  **Water Plane:** An underwater kingdom filled with exotic aquatic life and water elementals. Here, breath management and manipulation of water currents could play significant roles in navigation and puzzle-solving.
    
3.  **Air Plane:** A sky realm with floating islands and tumultuous winds, inhabited by air elementals. This biome would feature a lot of verticality, with wind currents and flying mechanics playing a crucial role.
    
4.  **Earth Plane:** A vast mountainous terrain populated with earth elementals. The gameplay in this level could revolve around manipulating the environment and dealing with ground-based hazards.
    

In addition to these biomes, there would be neutral zones where the elemental planes overlap. These mixed zones would feature a combination of elementals and environmental characteristics from the adjacent planes.

### Characters
1.  **The Wizard (Player Character):** The Wizard is a once powerful magic-user who inadvertently caused the creation of the Cradle of Elementals and is now trapped within it. Stripped of their former knowledge and power, they must relearn their magic and find a way to undo their mistake.
    
2.  **Elementals:** These are the native inhabitants of the Cradle, representing the various elemental planes. They come in various forms and have their own behaviors and abilities. The elementals serve as both foes to be overcome and potential sources of new spells.
    
3.  **Elder Elementals:** These are the powerful leaders of the elementals, acting as the main bosses within the game. They pose a significant threat to the player and offer substantial rewards when defeated.
    
4.  **Animals and NPCs:** These are the other inhabitants of the Cradle, each with their own needs and problems. They can offer quests or assistance to the player.

### Story
The story unfolds as the Wizard gradually regains their memory and learns about the elemental planes and the Cradle of Elementals. The Wizard starts off oblivious to the fact that they're the one who caused the Cradle's creation. As they explore the Cradle, they find remnants of their past actions and slowly put the pieces together.

They discover that in their pursuit of ultimate power, they tapped too deeply into the elemental planes, leading to their transformation into an elemental font and the subsequent creation of the Cradle of Elementals. The wizard's goal then becomes to undo this transformation and restore balance to the elemental planes.

Throughout the story, the Wizard encounters various NPCs, some of whom might recognize them and react with fear or anger. Others might see the Wizard as their only hope of escaping the storm. These interactions serve to further emphasize the Wizard's past mistakes and their responsibility to fix the chaos they've caused.

The story culminates in a final confrontation with the elemental planes themselves, each represented by their respective Elder Elemental. Upon their defeat, the Wizard must then confront their own past actions, leading to a climactic endgame scenario where they attempt to undo their transformation and restore balance to the elemental planes.
