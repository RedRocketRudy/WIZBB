You play as a mythical wizard trapped inside the "Cradle of Elementals," a raging storm of elemental magic triggered by the elemental planes' attempt to sever their connection with a wizard who turned themselves into an elemental font, spreading magic throughout the world. The game features a stylized cartoon shader art style, combining a visually appealing and unique aesthetic with an immersive, magical world.

Magic in this world is cast by visualizing its effects in one's imagination. However, casting too many spells in rapid succession can lead to wild magic evolutions, creating random, higher-level spells with unpredictable and powerful effects. These spells contain 65%-92% of the words in the description of the previous spells, recombined uniquely.

The Cradle of Elementals is filled with elemental soldiers, elite elementals, higher-grade beings, and portals to the elemental planes. Elemental shards, released when elementals are destroyed, are a highly sought-after resource that can be used as magical fuel, tools, or foci.

The game's goal is to navigate this storm, learn to control wild magic evolutions, and manage resources while understanding the complex dynamics of the elemental planes and their factions.

The world outside the Cradle largely ignores it, focusing instead on utilizing elemental shards for various purposes. The trading and distribution of elemental shards have significant impacts on the world's economy and social structures, creating a rich background for exploration and player interaction.

Groups or factions within the world that study the Cradle of Elementals, despite the inherent risks, add another layer of intrigue to the game. Understanding their goals and motivations may reveal new insights or opportunities for the player.

The conflict between the elemental planes and the wizard-elemental font has repercussions on the world and its inhabitants, presenting an ever-changing environment for the player to navigate.

The game is planned to be sold directly, with an initial donation-based model on itch.io before releasing on Steam and possibly consoles. This indie game promises a unique blend of immersive storytelling, strategic resource management, and creative magic system, providing a fresh and engaging experience for players.

Does this revised premise align with your vision for the game? If there's anything else you'd like to add or revise, feel free to share!

1.  Game premise: The player takes on the role of a master wizard who needs to learn all the spell combinations, collect various magical artifacts, and manage their phylactery while navigating the conflict between the four groups of elementals and their elder elementals.
    
2.  Basic mechanics: a. Spell casting: The player has access to all spells, abilities, and movement skills from the start, and they need to combine the correct words or use the advanced dictionary to view the spell combinations. b. Double jumping: The player can perform a double jump by creating a platform of the last element used in a spell. c. Elemental interactions: Opposite elements deal more damage to each other, while related elements are more likely to deflect, bounce, or get redirected by the stronger spell. d. Collecting magical artifacts: The player must find and collect various magical artifacts that change the way spell casting works. e. Elemental shards and energy mist: The player can collect elemental shards and energy mist, which can be used to upgrade stats, improve artifacts, or manage the phylactery. f. Phylactery: The player has a chained phylactery artifact equipped, which reduces their movement speed and jump height. The phylactery also allows the player to respawn close to their death location.
    
3.  Level design: Create a simple open-world environment that includes several biomes and the four elemental planes. Introduce players to the spell casting and double jumping mechanics, as well as interactions with the elementals and their elder elementals.
    
4.  Factions and AI: Implement basic AI for the four elemental factions and their elder elementals. These factions will fight each other, cooperate to stop the player, and possibly absorb each other to become stronger.
    
5.  Elder elementals as bosses: Design boss battles with elder elementals, which can become stronger by absorbing shards or other elementals. The player can also invade the elemental world to break the elder elemental's shard, causing them to weaken and release a large number of shards.
    
6.  Tutorial: Implement a brief tutorial to teach the player the basic controls, spell casting, double jumping mechanics, interactions with elementals, and phylactery management.
    
7.  Art and sound: Use simple, placeholder art and sound assets for the MVP to focus on the gameplay and mechanics.
    
8.  User interface: Design a basic UI that displays the player's current spell combinations, word charges, collected artifacts, elemental shards, and phylactery range.
